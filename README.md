## BioGraphy
- I have a strange personality, I always do several things at the same time, I like to be successful all the time and the only thing I fear is not being successful, I am very interested in the two topics of death and sleep because we don't know where we will go in these two situations :)
- I started programming in different fields from August 2022. I don't know what year you are reading this, but I have so much experience. I always wanted to be the best when working with computers, but when I entered the new world of social media, I realized that I have a lot of work to do to get a good grade
- My interest is different in every field
- First of all, let me say that I love football very much and I lived with football, as well as sports
- I always prioritize my physical skills because I think we should enjoy our whole life
- Unlike most of the programmers, I am extremely extroverted and I don't transfer any feelings into myself, I am a sociable person and....
- I am a classical Persian instrument player and I enjoy this work
- My favorite singers: MasterShajarian, Davidkushner, OliviaRodrigo
- My favorite actor is DiCaprio
- My favorite movie is Inception and my favorite series is The Walking Dead
- The director I love is also dear to Frank Drabant
I also forgot one thing, in my opinion, the best programmer in the world is Pavel Doruv
I just told you about my interests and experiences, I hope you got to know me
- the truth
(:They are calling Monty:)
## Advice 
- Don't give up until you have a really exciting idea. If you're undecided about a decision, go get some sleep and see how you feel about it when you wake up.
- If you want your life to be simpler, you need to get rid of other people's voices in your head. We are too influenced by people around us; Our relatives and friends and what they think about what constitutes success or what is good or bad. We must completely get rid of these influences. We should be able to be indifferent to what others think or say about our work. After this step we should focus only on what we need.
- EveryThink , EveryWhere , EveryOne We need ; There are in the ground , dont look up sky
